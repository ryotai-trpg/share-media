# Share Media

**Share Media** is a FoundryVTT module that allows Game Masters to quickly and seamlessly share images and videos with their players. Whether you want to display atmospheric artwork in a popup window, create cinematic moments with fullscreen media, or embed visuals directly onto the scene canvas, Share Media makes it effortless. Simply hover over any image or video in journals, character or item sheets, and instantly share it with all players or a selected group. The module eliminates the tedious process of creating dedicated journal entries just to share media, letting you focus on storytelling while enhancing your players' immersion.

## Version Compatibility

This version of Share Media has been completely rewritten from the ground up to support FoundryVTT v13 and beyond. The previous version's codebase was too outdated to integrate with FoundryVTT's new features and modern architecture. While this means the module is not backwards compatible with older FoundryVTT versions, rest assured that all original functionality has been preserved and enhanced, with new features added to provide an even better media sharing experience.
